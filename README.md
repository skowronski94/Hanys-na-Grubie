Strategy game prototype in Java 8.0 Swing.

Simple game in which you construct buildings which generate income. 
Income depend on type of a building and type of a terrain on which the building has been built.
Construction of each building has its cost so you cannot build when you do not 
have enough resources to do it.

For architecture details take a look at Class Diagram.
